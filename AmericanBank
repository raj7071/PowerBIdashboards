America Bank Dashboard

Problem Statement
This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into America Bank's customer demographics, loan profiles, and financial engagement. It helps identify trends in loan defaults, customer segmentation, and account balances. The insights enable the bank to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and minimize loan default risks.
The dashboard highlights key metrics such as customer balances, loan outcomes, and demographic distributions.

		○ Converted monetary values (e.g., balances) into numeric formats for analysis.
		○ Handled null and unknown values in columns like "poutcome" and "contact."
		○ Created calculated columns for customer segmentation by age groups and job classifications.
	3. Data Modeling:
		○ Established relationships between customer attributes and banking metrics.
		○ Created measures using DAX to calculate KPIs like average balance, loan default rate, and distribution by education level.
	4. Visualization:
		○ Designed an interactive dashboard featuring: 
			§ Customer segmentation by age, marital status, and education level.
			§ Loan statistics (e.g., house loans, other loans, loan default rates).
			§ Regional distribution of account balances and customer demographics.
			§ Trends in bank engagement (e.g., contact outcomes, date joined).
